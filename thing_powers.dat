<!-- This file contains the assortment of special Powers for the game system.
      Powers confer their effects through scripts that apply the necessary changes
      to the appropriate traits.

      Powers influence traits, so all adjustments must be applied prior to when the
      final trait value is calculated. The script timing used below (PreTraits/5000)
      ensures that we satisfy this requirement. All Powers should be designated as
      "unique" so that they can only be selected a single time by the user.

  <!-- Power BOOST Power -->

    name="Ability Boost"

    isunique="no"
    description="Ability Boost temporarily increases one ability, chosen when the power is acquired, making it a power group of six powers, one for each ability: Prowess Boost, Coordination Boost, Strength Boost, and so forth. Choose an ability. You can boost the chosen ability’s level up to the power level for a level duration. Then the ability’s level is reduced to one lower than its normal level for the same duration while it 'recovers.'\n\nExample: Strength Boost 8 raises your Strength level to 8 for 8 pages, then your Strength drops to 1 less than its normal level for 8 pages while you recover.\n\nIf you boost a level 0 ability, such as a power you don’t normally have, then it drops back to level 0 while it recovers, making it unusable during that time.\n\nWhen you determine the level for this power, any rolled result equal to or less than your existing ability level should be re-rolled until you get a higher level. Level 10 abilities cannot be boosted; choose or roll a different ability. Ability Boost only counts as a power for figuring Determination if its level is 7 or greater.">

Similarly, you gain no resistance to attacks, but can gain Heat Resistance in the domain of the Lava Men.
