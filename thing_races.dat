<!-- This file contains the assortment of races for the game system. The special
      advantages of each race are conferred through a combination of scripts and
      automatic assignment of special Powers. All special Powers are assigned
      via the bootstrapping of the Power, resulting in the Power being
      automatically assigned to the actor whenever the race is selected. If an Power
      is both user-selected AND conferred by a race, the Power only appears a single
      time because it all Powers are "unique".
