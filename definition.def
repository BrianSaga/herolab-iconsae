      the Skeleton data files contain examples of the most common behaviors you'll
      need and can be readily adapted to the game system you want to support. You'll
      find inline comments throughout all of the Skeleton data files that describe
      what is being done, as well as external documentation that outlines how
      everything is structured and how all the pieces fit together. A detailed
      example is also provided that outlines how to adapt these Skeleton data files

Mechanically, these data files are identical to the Skeleton data files that are used as a starting point when creating your own data files via the Authoring Kit. However, the Sample data files add an assortment of things that make them usable for experimentation. The added things provide a variety of examples of how to accomplish different behaviors.

You can play around with these data files to see how they work. You can also use the included things as excellent examples when creating your own data files with the Authoring Kit.
